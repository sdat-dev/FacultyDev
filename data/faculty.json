Prior work has examined how performance-based incentives in (primarily public) organizations affect organizational productivity and worker behavior.

This work (1) attempts to econometrically measure the importance of U.S. scientific and engineering (S&E) labor markets in determining and directing technological progress, (2) investigates the organization of science and R&D, including the evolution and life cycle of innovating teams and recent trends in scientific collaboration and their impacts on science, (3) measures impacts at person and society level of STEM education and training, (4) models the careers of S&E workers, and (5) estimates demand models for S&E workers (including under pandemic).","facultyLink":"https://www.albany.edu/economics/faculty/gerald-r-marschke","photo":"assets\\images\\Faculty\\F_1rk1Ju8uwaqpRCI.jpg","covidProjects":[],"onlineCV":"http://gmarschke.com/wp-content/uploads/marschkecv.pdf","researchGateProfile":"","googleScholarProfile":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnvOPScAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao","otherProfile":"gmarschke.com"},{"title":"Associate Professor","school":"College of Arts and Sciences","department":"Chemistry","fullName":"Jia Sheng","lastName":"Sheng","email":"jsheng@albany.edu","contact":"518-437-4419","researchInterest":"Chemical Biology; Synthetic Biology; Organic Chemistry; Nucleic Acids; RNA","researchDescription":"The long-term goal of our research is to understand nature’s strategies to diversify the structures and functions of RNA through chemical modifications and base pairing patterns; in so doing, we want to develop new methods for synthesizing modified RNA molecules as molecular tools for biomedical applications.","facultyLink":"https://www.albany.edu/shenglab/Home.html","photo":"","covidProjects":[],"onlineCV":"","researchGateProfile":"","googleScholarProfile":"","otherProfile":""},{"title":"Adjunct Research Faculty","school":"College of Arts and Sciences","department":"Institute for RNA Science and Technology","fullName":"Bijan Dey","lastName":"Dey","email":"bdey@albany.edu","contact":"518-437-4481","researchInterest":"noncoding RNA; Stem Cell; Muscular dystrophy; microRNA; epigenetics; molecular biology; regenerative medicine","researchDescription":"My laboratory studies the function of non-coding RNAs, epigenetics and epitranscriptomics in skeletal muscle stem cell biology, cardiac muscle biology, muscle regeneration, and muscle degenerative diseases including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and DMD-associated cardiomyopathy.

Poetry and other literary arts use the imagination in ways crucial for building communities, challenging norms and staid ideas, and pointing to future possibilities. These lessons have been epitomized in how arts and cultural production historically have been a major motor for reshaping queer community and mainstream America's perceptions of LGBTQ+ persons. During other periods of crisis in queer history, including the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the arts played a key role in ensuring individuals' and communities' survival. The literary arts not only provided solace during such times of crisis, but they also have helped spark changes of consciousness.

One condition that facilitates stable price adjustment is for consumers to become more different from each other in their desired purchases and sales of goods as they get richer.

For example, a writer’s choice of pronoun can predict the prevalence of words that express particular types  of meanings such as emotions. In an extension of that work to UA students writing about COVID, we document a relation between writing that indicates anxiety and a clinical measure based on self reported anxiety.  Both anxiety measures are strongly linked with the expression of sadness. Further, in the context of COVID, those who self report that they are anxious write more about financial as well as biological concerns including ingestion.\r\n Perhaps most interestingly,  those who write more about space and social distancing tend to write less about health and reveal less anxiety in their writing. \r\n","facultyLink":"https://www.albany.edu/psychology/faculty/laurie-feldman","photo":"","covidProjects":["language in social media"],"onlineCV":"","researchGateProfile":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurie_Feldman","googleScholarProfile":"","otherProfile":""},{"title":"Professor","school":"College of Arts and Sciences","department":"Psychology","fullName":"John Forsyth","lastName":"Forsyth","email":"forsyth@albany.edu","contact":"518-442-4862","researchInterest":"anxiety; stress; mental health; mindfulness; meditation; resilience; behavioral health","researchDescription":"Expertise: Anxiety, fear, worry, stress; mindfulness and meditation; acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT); self-compassion and kindness; human thriving; resilience, & living well.\r\n\r\nBrief Biography:\r\nJohn P.

Opioids and anti-inflammatories are the main treatments for intractable pain. Increasingly, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and duloxetine are prescribed as the first line of remedy against multifactorial pain, although how they work remains a mystery.  Since small late Na+ currents cause hyperexcitability and pain, we hypothesize that these antidepressants target late open Na+ channels via the local anesthetic (LA) receptor in a manner similar to antiarrhymthic flecainide, antianginal ranolazine, and anticonvulsant lacosamide. Our long-term goals are (1) to address how non-opiate pain therapeutics such as duloxetine work against intractable pain and (2) to identify novel analgesics that diminish persistent late Na+ currents via the LA receptor for pain relief.

Prior research has explored how the relationship between families and schools contributes to inequity in achievement and attainment, especially when schools are held accountable for students’ performance on external examinations.  Related research also examined how curriculum exposure and social relationships shape students’ academic trajectories, reflected in math course taking and grades, following the transition into high school.  My current research focuses on the role of school leaders and adaptations by teachers when implementing high stakes systemic reforms such as Common Core Learning Standards and Annual Professional Performance Reviews.","facultyLink":"https://www.albany.edu/education/faculty/kathryn-s-schiller","photo":"assets\\images\\Faculty\\F_DFTz8Lm2xDxFeRX.jpg","covidProjects":[],"onlineCV":"","researchGateProfile":"","googleScholarProfile":"","otherProfile":""},{"title":"Dean (Education)","school":"School of Education","department":"Dean's Office--School of Education","fullName":"Jason Lane","lastName":"Lane","email":"jlane@albany.edu","contact":"518-442-4988","researchInterest":"Higher Education Leadership; Higher Education Finance; Remote Education ; University Systems ; International Education ; International Students","researchDescription":"Jason E.

These technologies can disrupt outdated practices in alternative and integrated medicine such as exercise-based therapy and the use of natural products. To empower providers and patients, I am building an integrated AI system to identify optimal treatment plans based on personalized exercise routines, adherence level and other particular lifestyle factors. This system can be very useful amid a pandemic such as the COVID-19 when in-person medical visits and therapeutic sessions are restricted. I enjoy collaborating with students and organizations for community-based projects with broad societal impact. I have built social media platforms to increase health awareness for underserved communities and correct misinformation. I am also interested in global health research, and I have participated in the Global Burden of Disease Collaborative for close to 10 years.","facultyLink":"https://www.albany.edu/sph/faculty/ricky-c-leung","photo":"assets\\images\\Faculty\\F_246gSKesLFW6SFU.jpg","covidProjects":[],"onlineCV":"","researchGateProfile":"","googleScholarProfile":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wTuogtwAAAAJ","otherProfile":"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2011302&HistoricalAwards=false"},{"title":"Associate Professor","school":"School of Public Health","department":"Biomedical Sciences","fullName":"Hongmin Li","lastName":"Li","email":"hongmin.li@health.ny.gov","contact":"(518) 473-4201","researchInterest":"antiviral development; structural biology; Zika virus; Dengue virus; SARS Cov-2; Antifungal development; Cryptococcus neoformans","researchDescription":"My laboratory focuses on both basic and translational sciences.
